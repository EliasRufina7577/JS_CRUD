# JS_CRUD
I created my CRUD app by selecting a tech stack, setting up a database, building backend APIs, and connecting them to the frontend. I designed forms, implemented validations, handled errors, tested functionality, and deployed it using hosting platforms. The app allows users to create, read, update, and delete data efficiently.
